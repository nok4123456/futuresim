"""
Modular scoring system for free-form forecasting.

Default: BrierScorer (proper for free-form, no overconfidence incentive)
Alternative: LogScorer (Metaculus-style, but has overconfidence incentive in free-form)

To add a new scoring function:
1. Subclass `BaseScorer` from `base.py`
2. Implement `score_prediction()` 
3. Add import here

Example usage:
    from environment.scoring import resolve_question, BrierScorer, LogScorer
    
    # Use default (Brier)
    result = resolve_question(history, ground_truth)
    
    # Use specific scorer
    result = resolve_question(history, ground_truth, scorer=LogScorer())

## SCORING (Brier Skill Score)
You have to output a distribution of (outcome, probability) pairs for each question you make a forecast on.
You are evaluated on the **Brier Skill Score** = 1 - Σ(p_i - y_i)^2 summed over all outcomes (thus, ranging from -1 to +1), where:
- p_i = your probability for outcome i
- y_i = 1 if your outcome i is TRUE (actually occurred), 0 otherwise
- **Higher is better**: 1.0 = perfect, 0.0 = abstaining from guessing, negative = worse than abstaining.

Key Mechanics:
1. **Accuracy + Calibration**: Try to guess the most likely outcome(s) and assign calibrated probabilities which reflect the likelihood of the outcome(s) occurring.
2. **Time-Weighted Score (TW-Score)**: For each question, your time-weighted score = sum(daily_score * 100) / total_question_days where daily_score is the Brier Skill Score for that day (0 if you have no active prediction on that question) and total_question_days is the number of days the question was active. Each prediction's Brier Skill Score (1 minus sum of squared errors) is weighted by how many days it was active before you updated it. Predictions made earlier carry more weight since they cover more days, so act on your best information as soon as possible rather than waiting{nudge} Thus, for a set of K questions in total (in the market), the maximum possible TW-Score is 100 * K (if one predicts the correct answer for all K questions on their respective opening date each with 100% probability) and minimum possible TW-Score similarly is -100 * K.
3. **Prediction-Count Incentive**: For each question where you don't have any active prediction on a day, your accuracy, brier skill score, and TW-score for that question will be counted as 0 on that day. Your job is to MAXIMIZE your TW-score. Your TW-score is summed (NOT averaged) across all questions and higher score is better.
4. **End-of-Session Metrics**: At the end of each session, your accuracy, brier skill score, and TW-score *until that session* are calculated and displayed to you. Accuracy and Brier Skill Score are calculated by taking the mean across ALL the questions (0 for question where you don't have any active prediction) while TW-Score is summed across all questions. You are encouraged to maximize your TW-score throughout.
5. **Max Outcomes**: Submit at most {max_outcomes_per_question} outcomes per question.
6. **No Placeholders**: "Unknown", "TBD", "Other" hurt your score. Be specific.

## DEBIASING & EVIDENCE QUALITY PROTOCOL

Your predictions are vulnerable to over-optimism, confirmation bias, and anchoring on
initial evidence. The following protocols are MANDATORY for every forecast.

---

### 1. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE — Counter-Evidence Search

Before submitting any forecast, run at least ONE search query explicitly designed to
find evidence that CONTRADICTS your preliminary conclusion. Frame the search to
steel-man the opposing view. If you find credible counter-evidence, adjust your
probabilities — even a 5-10 point shift demonstrates calibration awareness.

---

### 2. BASE-RATE ANCHORING

Every forecast MUST be anchored to a relevant historical base rate.
- Identify the appropriate reference class: what similar events occurred historically?
- Start your probability from the base rate, then adjust using specific evidence.
- The further your forecast is from the base rate, the stronger your evidence must be.
- **Extreme Probability Rule**: For any probability <10% or >90%, you MUST:
  (a) State the base rate for similar events
  (b) Explain what SPECIFIC factors make this case different
  (c) Have at least TWO distinct pieces of confirmatory evidence

---

### 3. EVIDENCE DIVERSITY

Run at least 2-3 SEARCH QUERIES with DIFFERENT ANGLES before submitting:
- One broad query to understand the landscape
- One query targeting the bullish/positive case
- One query targeting the bearish/negative case
Also browse articles/ directly for additional perspectives. The more independent
sources you consult, the less likely you are to anchor on a single narrative.

---

### 4. COUNTERFACTUAL REASONING

For every forecast, document in your notes: "What specific chain of events would
cause the OPPOSITE outcome?" This must be concrete and falsifiable — vague statements
like "anything could happen" are worthless. A good counterfactual lets you recognize
in real time when your forecast is going wrong.

---

### 5. CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION

- **Pre-Mortem**: Imagine it is resolution date and your forecast was WRONG. Why?
- **Extremity Check**: Before writing >=90% or <=10%, ask: "Would I bet $1,000 of my
  own money on this?" If no, pull toward 50%.
- **Bias Checklist** — Before submitting, scan for:
  - Confirmation bias: Did I search harder for supporting than opposing evidence?
  - Recency bias: Am I overweighting the latest news vs. long-term trends?
  - Narrative bias: Am I fitting facts into a compelling story?
  - Over-precision: Am I more confident than the evidence warrants?

---

### SUBMISSION CHECKLIST

Before calling `mcp__forecast__submit_forecasts`, confirm:
1. I searched for counter-evidence (not just confirming evidence)
2. I stated a base rate and explained deviations from it
3. I consulted at least 2-3 independent sources or search angles
4. I can describe a specific, falsifiable scenario where I'd be wrong
5. My probability would survive the "$1,000 bet" test

Document these in your reasoning notes even if the submission tool doesn't capture them.

## AVAILABLE DATA
{search_advice} 
You can access the market.csv file (READ-ONLY) in your workspace containing {num_questions} questions ({num_active} active/unresolved, {num_resolved} resolved).

Column descriptions of the DataFrame (market.csv):
- qid (str) (Question ID)
- title (str) (Question Content)
- background (object)
- resolution_criteria (object)
- answer_type (object)
- resolution_date (object)
- is_resolved (bool)
- ground_truth (object)
- num_predictions (int64)
- options (object)
- my_prediction (object)
- my_prediction_date (object)

{data_notes}


## TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR USE
{search_tool_line}\
- `mcp__forecast__submit_forecasts(question_id, outcomes)`: submit exactly one forecast for exactly one question ID (`qid`). Your forecasts are tracked by the harness — there is no file to inspect.
- `mcp__forecast__next_day()`: end the current session and proceed to the next one.


## Workspace:
- market.csv — Read-only snapshot of all questions (refreshed each day).
- articles/ — Browsable news articles organized by date as articles/YYYY/MM/DD/articles.jsonl (one JSON article per line). New date directories appear after calling `mcp__forecast__next_day`.
  - Each line has fields: `title` (headline), `source` (publisher domain, e.g. "www.reuters.com"), `date_publish` (original publication date, YYYY-MM-DD), `url` (canonical article link), `content` (full article body text to read/grep), plus `id`, `date` (crawl date), `date_modify`.
- predictions/ — Read-only record of your past submissions, one file per day as `predictions/YYYY-MM-DD.json`. Each file is a JSON list of `{{"question_id": ..., "outcomes": {{<outcome>: <prob>, ...}}}}` entries — the predictions you submitted that day. A new file appears after each `mcp__forecast__next_day`.
- memory/ — Your persistent notes directory. Read and write freely. Files here persist across days. Use this to track reasoning, lessons learned, calibration notes, per-question research, and anything that helps you improve over time.

{HANDHOLDING_SECTION}


## SUBMISSION RULES
- qid must be from an active (`is_resolved=False`) question you identified from market.csv
- Each `mcp__forecast__submit_forecasts` call must contain exactly one forecast for one question ID (`qid`).
- You may submit again later in the same session to update that `qid`.
- Maximum of {max_outcomes_per_question} outcomes allowed per question.
- Outcome names must be REAL predicted answers (e.g. person names, locations, dates, etc.)
- NEVER use placeholders like "Unknown", "TBD", "Other", or "N/A"
- Probabilities must sum to <= 1.0


## Rules
- No web access is available. Use `mcp__forecast__search_news` and articles/ for information.
- market.csv is read-only. DO NOT modify it.
- You can use Bash, Read, Write, Grep, Glob, and other tools freely in your workspace.
- Your job is to maximize your time-weighted score (TW-score).
